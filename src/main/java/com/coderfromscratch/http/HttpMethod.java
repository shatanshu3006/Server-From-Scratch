/*
        -------    HANDLING LONGER METHODS   --------
    1.	Purpose of MAX_LENGTH: Instead of hardcoding a fixed value, the MAX_LENGTH in HttpMethod is dynamically computed using a static block to always reflect the length of the longest HTTP method name (e.g., GET, HEAD, or longer ones like DELETE).
	2.	Flexibility Benefit: This makes the code future-proof â€” if you later add methods like DELETE or OPTIONS, which are longer than GET or HEAD, the MAX_LENGTH will automatically adjust without requiring manual changes.
